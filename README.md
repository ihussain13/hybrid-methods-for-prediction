# hybrid-methods-for-prediction
In this paper, we proposed two novel hybrid methods to address these issues for the forecasting of mineral resources. Our methods are based on denoising, decomposition, prediction and ensemble principles that are applied to the production of mineral resources time-series data. The performance of our proposed methods is compared with existing methods based on mean relative error, mean absolute error and mean square error as evaluation measures by using the production of four principle mineral resources of Pakistan
